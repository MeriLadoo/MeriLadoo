			The average person lives for about 27375 days, so many of those days go unnoticed and forgotten because nothing special
			happened in them. For the last 8,400 days since I was born, I only remember 300,
			about 30 of them are just family happy moments. Most of them are basically just me telling my mother the good news
			of me passing the year in school. Happiest day of them was when she cried of happiness when I passed the national
			exam. The rest of those days started on the 24th of august, and still going till this day. There's not a single minute
			that goes by where I don't think about you. </td>
			<td border-bottom-style="hidden"style="font-size: 35px; padding: 20px;border-bottom-color:lightgrey">It is true that we have our ups and downs just like all relationships do.
			And like all relationships, not only good times build a strong basis for that relationships, sometimes bad moments teach us more lessons
			than anything else. I just hope that in future there will be less bad times, since we've grown better as humans first, and as a couple second.
			Yesterday we passed our 9 months milestone, it's like we gave birth to a baby, that baby is our relationship. And as far as my knowledge goes,
			the last months of a pregnancy are the hardest, and that was what happened to us.</td>
